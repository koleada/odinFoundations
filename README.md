# odinWebDevelopment
I will be sharing my progression through the Odin Fouundation web development course. Inside will be notes, practice, projects and anything else I make throughout the course. I plan to continue onwards after I finish to the full-stack javascript course so expect that repository as well. 

I will also likley create project specific repos once I feel that what I'm creating is worth it :)
