    <!-- <p> is used here to create 1 line of whitespace between the links and put them each on their own line -->
    <p>
        <!-- target=_blank will make it so clicking the link will open it in a new tab. exchnaging this for _self will open in the the same tab. leaving blank also opens in same tab -->
        <!-- noopener  prevents the prevents this opened link from gaining access from the webpage from which it was opened.
        noreferrer prevents the link from knowing which website has a link (or reference to it)   This is a security feature 
        to keep users safe and prevent people from changing links maliciously eg phishing attacks. noreferrer does what 
        noopener does and more so we can use that one by itself if we wish-->
        <!-- must include https and domain for absolute link! -->
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click Me</a>
        <!-- This is an absolute link as it references an outside external webpage whereas a relative link refers to another page on the same site. -->
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- THis is a relative link references another page on the same page (no domain name or protocol) -->
        <a href="about.html">About Page</a>

    <!-- since the image is in a different directory we must use the ./ to signal it is 1 level away -->
    <!-- src points to the local image file, alt is used to describe the image and will be displayed if the image cannot be displayed -->
    <!-- its best practice to specify the height and width on every image even if we plan to change it with css or if the image is already the correct size -->
