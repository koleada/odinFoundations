Now that we can alter the DOM we can use EVENTS to dynamically change things as users click, type etc. 

There are 3 main ways to achieve this: 
1. specify function attributes directly on HTML elements 
** not ideal as we can only set 1 "onclick" property per element 

2. Set properties of form on[eventType] (onclick, onmousedown, etc) on the DOM nodes in your JavaScript 
** still can only handle 1 of each event per element

3. Attach event listeners to the DOM nodes in your JavaScript 
** these are the preferred method but the others are also common and useful. This is a bit more complex to set up but much more powerful.

All of these can be used with functions we create ourselves too, they do not have to be built in functions. As shown below: 

method 1 with our own defined function:
<button onclick="alertFunction()">CLICK ME BABY</button>
// the JavaScript file 
// METHOD 1
function alertFunction() {
  alert("YAY! YOU DID IT!");
}

method 2 and 3 with our own function: 
<button id="btn">CLICK ME BABY</button>
// the JavaScript file 
// METHODS 2 & 3
function alertFunction() {
  alert("YAY! YOU DID IT!");
}
const btn = document.querySelector('#btn')

// METHOD 2
btn.onclick = alertFunction;

// METHOD 3
btn.addEventListener('click', alertFunction);

we can pass in "e" to the event listen to put more information about the event in the console or alert it or whatever we want ex: 
btn.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  console.log(e.target);
});
**e.target just gives us even more information 

or we could do

btn.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
    e.target.style.background = 'blue';
});
changes the background of the element that triggered the event to blue 


we can also use document.querySelectorAll() to select all elements of a certain class or type (eg span or button)
this allows us to add events for multiple elements by just adding a single event listener to a single variable created using querySelectorAll. 

Useful events: click, dblclick, keydown, keyup. full list of events + explanations here https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp
