Specificity in CSS is used to determine which rule or style will be applied to an element if there are conflicting rules. 
Selectors: ID-most specific, Class-second most specific, type-third most specific universal selector (*)- least specific.
Example: there is a conflict where an element has 2 conflicting rules. One rule uses one class selector but the other conflicting rule used 2 class selectors. The latter would be more specific
and therefore would be the rule that is ultimately applied. If this same situation happened but one conflicting rule uses and ID selector and the other uses 2 class selectors the ID selector is 
more specific and therefore would be the rule that is applied. Final example: one rule has an ID selector and the other has an ID and a class selector, the latter would be applied as it is 
more specific. 

Some properties color, font-size, font-family are inherited by children of an element styled with these properties even if you dont explicitly write the code. If you were to style one of these 
elements that inherited a property that would always take precedent over inheritance.

Finally if there are 2 conflicting rules of the exact same specificity say both using a class selector, then the one written last (closest to the bottom of the code) 
will be the one that is applied.
