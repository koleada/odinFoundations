Different display types have unique box models, we can modify the box calculation by changing the display property. 2 box types - block and inline, which determine element 
behavior and interaction. The display property controls how HTML elements appear on the webpage. 

Most HTML elements are block elements. IN other words by default their style is display: block;  block elements appear on w page stacked on top of one another, each new element starting on 
its own new line. Inline elements do not start on a new line, they are displayed next to (inline) whatever elements they are placed beside. An example of an inline element is the <a> tag if
it is in the middle of a paragraph it will act as part of the paragraph. The link will sit alongside the text. 

Padding and margin behave different on inline elements, generally you don't want to put extra padding or margin on inline elements.

inline-block: a sort of middle ground between block and inline. Elements with this display type behave like inline elements but with block style padding and margin. 
Useful to know but likely will more often use flexbox to line up a bunch of boxes. 

Divs and Spans: Essentially generic boxes that can contain anything. Very useful for grouping elements we want to share a style or to correctly position them on a page. 

div: Div is a block-level element by default. It is commonly used as a container element to group other elements.
Divs allow us to divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks.

span: Span is an inline-level element by default. It can be used to group text content and inline HTML elements
for styling and should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate.

** before changing the display or any styles at all it is best to first create a webpage made up of well structured HTML that is readable with normal flow (eg default display type) then changing
if needed **
